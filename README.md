### Bender is no longer being maintained. If you are already using it, consider migrating to an actively developed serializer like JSON.NET.

Bender is a highly configurable xml, json, CSV and form url encoded serialization library for .NET. Unlike other serializers, Bender gives you complete control over the serialization process though a simple API.

- Not strongly named.
- One serializer for json, XML, CSV and form url encoded.
- [Readers](#readers), [writers](#writers) and [visitors](#visitors) give you full control of serialization and deserialization.
- [Naming conventions](#naming-conventions) give you full control over naming.
- [Friendly deserialization error messages](#friendly-deserialization-error-messages) allow you to give valuable feedback to consumers of your API.
- Supports enums, nullable types, `String`, `Char`, `Boolean`, `SByte`, `Byte`, `Int16`, `UInt16`, `Int32`, `UInt32`, `Int64`, `UInt64`, `Single`, `Double`, `Decimal`, `DateTime`, `Guid`, `TimeSpan`, `Uri`, `IntPtr`, `UIntPtr`, `Array`, `ArrayList` (Serialization only), `IEnumerable` (Serialization only), `IEnumerable<T>`,  `IDictionary` (Serialization only), `IDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `byte[]` (As Base64), `MailAddress`, `Version`, `IPAddress` and `SqlConnectionStringBuilder` out of the box.
- Supports `XmlAttributeAttribute`, and `XmlIgnoreAttribute` attributes.
- Supports `XmlArrayAttribute` and `XmlArrayItemAttribute` attributes, name properties.
- Supports `XmlRootAttribute`, `XmlTypeAttribute` and `XmlElementAttribute` attributes, name and namespace properties.
- Extensibility point to override object creation during deserialization with your own implementation.
- Filtering options for types, members and visibility.
- Options for name comparison and ignoring names of certain elements altogether.
- Options for failing on unmatched members or elements.
- Ability to serialize and deserialize members of enumerable and dictionary implementations.
- Ability to transform XML during deserialization.
- Ability to define [optional types](#optional-types).

## Install

Bender can be found on nuget:

    PM> Install-Package Bender

## Basic Usage

The `Serialize` and `Deserialize` convenience methods allow you to easily serialize or deserialize:

```csharp
public class Model
{
    public string Property { get; set; } 
}

var model = "{\"Property\":\"value\"}".DeserializeJson<Model>();
var model = "<Model><Property>value</Property></Model>".DeserializeXml<Model>();

var json = new Model { Property = "value" }.SerializeJson();
var xml = new Model { Property = "value" }.SerializeXml();
```

Additional convenience methods take or return a `byte[]`, `Stream`, file path, `XDocument`, `XElement` and `INode`. 

## Configuration

Bender can be configured in a number of different ways depending on your needs.  First, the configuration DSL is available on all convenience and factory methods:

```csharp
var model = "{ ... }".DeserializeJson<Model>(o => { ... });
var serializer = Serializer.Create(o => { ... });
var deserializer = Deserializer.Create(o => { ... });
```

Second, you can create options with the options factory method and pass those in later:

```csharp
var options = Options.Create(o => { ... });

var model = "{ ... }".DeserializeJson<Model>(options);
var serializer = new Serializer(options);
var deserializer = new Deserializer(options);
```

## Overriding Serialization and Deserialization

Bender has a number of extensibility points. The following covers these in more detail.

### Attributes

Bender supports a number of attributes that override serialization and deserialization.

| Attribute | Format | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `XmlIgnoreAttribute` | All | Indicates that a member should not be serialized or deserialized. |
| `XmlArrayAttribute` | All | Overrides the name of an enumerable member. |
| `XmlElementAttribute` | All | Overrides the name of a member. |
| `XmlRootAttribute` | XML | Overrides the name of the root element. |
| `XmlTypeAttribute` | XML | Overrides the name of the root element or an enumerable item. |
| `XmlAttributeAttribute` | XML | Indicates that a member should be serialized as an XML attribute and optionally overrides it's name. |
| `XmlArrayItemAttribute` | XML | Overrides the name of an enumerable item. |
| `XmlSiblingsAttribute` | XML | Serializes or deserializes an enumerable item as a sibling of other members in the type. |
| `WithAttributeAttribute` | XML | Adds an attribute to an element. |

### Naming Conventions

Bender ships with some common naming conventions out of the box: `camelCase`,  `snake_case`, `spinal-case` and `Train-Case`. You can add your own naming conventions with the `With*NamingConvention()` options. There are options to override naming for fields, properties, members (fields and properties), array items, types or all of the above. Each option method has an overload that applies to all and one that takes a predicate to limit its application. Naming conventions form a pipeline where a name is modified by one convention and then passed to the next convention to be modified further. This allows you to define multiple conventions that work together. The order that the conventions are defined is the order they will execute.

Lets take a look at an arbitrary example where we create a couple of naming conventions.

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o
    .WithPropertyNamingConvention(
        (name, member) => name + "EmailAddress",
        (name, member) => member.Type == typeof(MailAddress))
    .WithNamingConvention(name => "_" + name));
```

In the first convention we append `EmailAddress` to the name when the property is of type `MailAddress`. Next we define a convention that prepends an `_` to every name. If we had a property named `Support` of type `MailAddress` the name would end up being `_SupportEmailAddress`.

Bender also allows you to define naming conventions for enum values. Enum values are not included in the global naming convention (As demonstrated above) as it is assumed that they will differ from type and member naming conventions. Below we see the convenience method for snake casing and it's actual implementation. 

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o.UseEnumSnakeCaseNaming());

Options.Create(o => o
    .WithEnumNamingConvention(
        (value, context) => value.Replace("_", ""),
        (value, context) => context.Mode == Mode.Deserialize)
    .WithEnumNamingConvention(
        (value, context) => value.ToSeperatedCase(false, "_"),
        (value, context) => context.Mode == Mode.Serialize);
```

### Visitors

Visitors enable you to operate on each node in the target graph. Both serialization and deserialization options contain methods for adding visitors. Each option method has an overload that applies to all and one that takes a predicate to limit its application. There are also convenience methods that apply visitors to either xml or json or specific types.

Lets take a look at an xml visitor for serialization that adds a `nil` attribute when a value is null.

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o
    .Serialization(s => s
        .AddXmlNamespace("xsi", "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance")
        .AddXmlVisitor(
            (source, target, options) => 
                target.Element.Add(new XAttribute("xsi:nil", "true")),
            (source, target, options) => source.NodeType.IsValue() && 
                         source.Value == null)));
```

### Readers

Readers read values from a source like xml or json during deserialization. Each option method has an overload that applies to all and one that takes a predicate to limit its application. There are also convenience methods that apply readers to specific types.

Lets look at an example where we read an IP address.

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o
    .Deserialization(d => d
        .AddReader(value => IPAddress.Parse(value.ToString()))));
```

You can also define readers for nullable and non-nullable types separately if you want to have fine grained control, for example if you wanted to override how `bool`'s are parsed:

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o
    .Deserialization(d => d
        .AddReader<bool>(value => bool.Parse(value.ToString()))
        .AddReader<bool?>(value => 
			!string.IsNullOrEmpty(value.ToString()) ? 
				(bool?)bool.Parse(value.ToString()) : null)));
```
    
But most of the time the functionality will be the same for nullable and non nullable readers and writers, save the boilerplate null checking logic. So you can define one writer for both nullable and non-nullable types by passing true to the `handleNullable` parameter:

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o
    .Deserialization(d => d
        .AddReader<bool>(value => bool.Parse(value.ToString()), true)));
```

### Writers

Writers write values to a target like xml or json during serialization. Each option method has an overload that applies to all and one that takes a predicate to limit its application. There are also convenience methods that apply readers to specific types and indicate if nullable types are included.

Lets look at an example where we write an IP address.

```csharp
Options.Create(o => o
    .Serialization(s => s
        .AddWriter<IPAddress>(value => value.ToString())));
```

## Optional Types

Sometimes when deserializing you may want to know when source values were set. For example, an API that will only update values that were passed. Or you may only want to serialize values that have been set. One approach is to ignore all null values, using nullable value types. The problem with this is that null might actually be a valid value. To address this issue, Bender supports optional types. Optional types are akin to nullable types, with `HasValue` and `Value` properties. They can also be implicitly and explicitly cast. Lets say we have an API that lets users set a termination date, among other things, which can be null. The json will be deserialized to the following model:

```csharp
public class EmployeeModel
{
	public Optional<string> Name { get; set; }
	public Optional<DateTime?> TerminationDate { get; set; }
	...
}
```

And lets say the user passes the following json to our API:

```json
{
	"terminationDate": null
}
```

The model can then be mapped appropriately since we know what values were passed:

```csharp
if (employeeModel.Name.HasValue)
	employeeEntity.Name = employeeModel.Name;

if (employeeModel.TerminationDate.HasValue)
	employeeEntity.TerminationDate = employeeModel.TerminationDate;
```

This will ignore the name field as it was not passed but set the termination date to null.

The opposite occurs on serialization. For example lets say we return the model above, with only the termination date set, from our API:

```csharp
new EmployeeModel {
	TerminationDate = null
}
```

This would produce the following json:

```json
{
	"terminationDate": null
}
```

All other properties on the model will not be serialized as they were not set. Note, the `IncludeNullMembers()` configuration option must be used to serialize null values.

## Friendly Deserialization Error Messages

Errors during deserialization can result from issues with the source or with your code and configuration. In an API consumed by others, the former can likely be addressed by your end users if they have good feedback. With that in mind, all Bender deserialization exceptions that are caused by a problem with the source inherit from `FriendlyBenderException`. This exception has a property named `FriendlyMessage` that can be displayed to end users and give them information to help them resolve the problem. Unlike the raw error messages, no internal information is included. 

Bender also has default friendly messages for parsing simple types and these can be overridden by calling the `WithFriendlyParseErrorMessage<T>(string message)` method in the deserialization options. Also, when creating readers you can make use of friendly parse error messages by specifying one for the type your reader handles:

```csharp
var deserializer = Deserializer.Create(o => o
    .Deserialization(d => d
        .WithFriendlyParseErrorMessage<IPAddress>(
            "IP addresss not formatted correctly, must be formatted as '1.2.3.4'.")
        .AddReader(value => IPAddress.Parse(value.ToString()))));
```
  
Any errors resulting from the reader will be wrapped in a `FriendlyBenderException` with the friendly error specified.

## Performance

Bender has traded some performance for flexibility so does not match the speed of other serializers. It averages ~.05 ms/KB (2.8 GHz i7) so would be more than enough for most applications. But if raw speed is a requirement you might want to look at the [ServiceStack serializers](https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/mythz_blog/blob/master/pages/344.md) or [fastJSON](https://fastjson.codeplex.com/).
